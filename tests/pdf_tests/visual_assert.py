"""
Utility class for visual regression testing of PDFs and images.

This class provides static methods to compare rendered PDF files
and image files by converting them into PNGs (if necessary) and
computing pixel-wise differences. The comparison is parallelized
across multiple threads for efficiency.

Typical responsibilities include:

* Converting PDF files to PNG images using Ghostscript.
* Loading and resizing images to a fixed resolution for consistent
  comparisons.
* Splitting the pixel grid into column ranges and comparing them
  across threads to compute average differences.
* Providing an assertion-like ``assert_equals`` method that returns
  a floating-point similarity score between two inputs.

The ``VisualAssert`` class is primarily intended for automated
testing, ensuring that generated PDFs visually match expected
output (ground truth). It supports both direct image-to-image and
PDF-to-PDF comparisons.

        Compare two PDFs or images and return their visual difference.

        This method performs a pixel-wise comparison between two inputs,
        which may be either PDF files or image files. If a PDF is
        provided, it is converted to a PNG image of the first page using
        Ghostscript before comparison. Both images are resized to a
        consistent resolution to ensure fair comparison.

        The comparison is computed in parallel across multiple threads,
        each handling a slice of the image columns. The result is a
        floating-point score representing the average normalized difference
        between corresponding pixels in the two images.

        A score of ``0.0`` indicates perfect equality, while higher scores
        indicate greater visual differences.
