If you believe it’s a bug:
- Verify it’s not caused by your code.
- Provide clear details:
  - **Overview:** What’s the issue? Include error messages or stack traces.
  - **Motivation/Use Case:** Why is this a problem for you?
  - **Environment:** Include your OS, **borb** version, etc.
  - **Steps to Reproduce:** Include a [Minimal, Complete, Verifiable Example (MCVE)](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before submitting a Pull Request:

1. Search [GitHub][pull] for existing PRs to avoid duplication.
2. Sign the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](#signing-the-cla).
3. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
4. Make your changes with **tests and documentation**.
5. Follow the [Coding Rules](#coding-rules).
6. Write a descriptive commit message following our [Git Commit Guidelines](#git-commit-guidelines).
7. Run all tests locally to ensure they pass.
8. Push your changes and create a Pull Request:
   - Set your fork as the "Head fork."
   - Set the **borb** repository as the "Base fork."

**If changes are requested:**
- Make updates, fix commits (if needed), and re-run tests.
- Force-push updates to your fork to refresh the Pull Request.

Once merged, you can safely delete your fork and sync your local repository with upstream changes.

## Coding Rules

To ensure consistency and maintain the quality of the codebase, please follow these rules:

- **Tests:** Every new feature or bug fix must include one or more unit tests to ensure correctness.
- **Documentation:** All public API methods must be properly documented for clarity and usability.
- **Formatting:** Use the `black` code formatter to maintain a consistent code style.
- **Type Checking:** Validate your code using `MyPy` to ensure type correctness.

### Automated Checks

Our repository employs **GitHub Actions** to automatically enforce these rules and maintain consistency. When you create a pull request, the following checks are performed:

- **Code Formatting:** Verified using `black`.
- **Type Checking:** Ensured with `MyPy`.
- **Documentation Compliance:** Checked with `pydocstyle`.
- **Dependency Management:** Verified with a custom Python script to ensure all dependencies are properly managed.
- **Inheritance Validation:** A custom Python script ensures that all `LayoutElement` objects are initialized correctly.
- **Method Argument Order:** A custom Python script verifies that method arguments are sorted consistently.
- **Python Shebang Presence:** A custom Python script checks for the presence of a proper Python shebang.
- **Visibility Markers:** A custom Python script ensures the presence of visibility markers (`CONSTRUCTOR`, `PRIVATE`, `PUBLIC`) in code where required.
- **Test Coverage and Functionality:** Ensures that tests are comprehensive and pass successfully.

### Addressing Failures

If any of these automated checks fail, you will need to address the identified issues before your pull request can be merged. These checks are designed to maintain a consistent, high-quality codebase and streamline collaboration among contributors.

## Git Commit Guidelines

### Why Commit Guidelines?

Clear and consistent commit messages make it easier to navigate project history. These guidelines are based on Chris Beams' blog post [How to Write a Git Commit Message][git-commit].

### Commit Message Format

A commit message includes:
```
<subject> 
<BLANK LINE> 
<body> 
<BLANK LINE> 
<footer>
```

- **Subject:**

    Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
    Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").
    Do not end the subject line with a period.
    Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.

- **Body:**

    Wrap lines at 72 characters for readability.
    Use the body to explain what the change is and why it is needed, not how it was done.

- **Footer:**

    Include references to relevant issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
    Mention any Breaking Changes, if applicable.
