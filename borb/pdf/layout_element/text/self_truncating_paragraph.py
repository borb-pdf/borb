"""
A self-truncating paragraph with uniform text styling.

This class serves as the semantic equivalent of :class:`Paragraph` within
the self-truncating paragraph hierarchy. It inherits all behavior from
:class:`SelfTruncatingHomogeneousParagraph`, maintaining a consistent
public API across the homogeneous and heterogeneous paragraph types.

The class itself introduces no new behavior; it exists purely for naming
and structural consistency within the layout system.
