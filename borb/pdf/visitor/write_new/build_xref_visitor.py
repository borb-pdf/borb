"""
Visitor class for building the cross-reference (XRef) table in a PDF.

`BuildXRefVisitor` is a specialized visitor used in the initial stages
of PDF serialization to construct the XRef table. It iterates through
objects in the PDF document structure, replacing each object with a
`Reference` where appropriate, thus marking it as an item to be cross-referenced.
This class is primarily responsible for identifying which objects need to
be added to the XRef table and creating these references.

This visitor does not handle the persistence or writing of the XRef table
itself; it only prepares the objects for later serialization. Actual
persistence of the XRef data is handled by other components in the
serialization process, following the completion of this visitor's work.
