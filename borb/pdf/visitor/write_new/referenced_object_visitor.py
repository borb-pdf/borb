"""
Visitor that writes referenced PDF objects in 'obj ... endobj' form.

This class is part of the PDF serialization pipeline in borb. It handles
objects that are indirectly referenced (i.e., those with an object number
and generation number) and emits their serialized representation in
accordance with the PDF specification.

It expects each visited node to be an instance of `ReferencedObjectType`,
which bundles a `reference` with its associated `PDFType` object.

The output follows this structure:
    <object_nr> <generation_nr> obj
    <serialized object>
    endobj

        This method is called when a node does not have a specialized handler.
