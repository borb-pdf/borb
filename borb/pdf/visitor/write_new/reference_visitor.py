"""
A visitor class for handling the writing or processing of reference objects within the PDF structure.

The `ReferenceVisitor` class is responsible for traversing and processing nodes
that contain references in the PDF document tree. It ensures that reference
objects are correctly written or exported, managing the necessary formatting,
resolution of reference links, and any specific requirements related to PDF references.

This class inherits from the `WriteNewVisitor` class, providing a consistent
approach to processing reference nodes while maintaining the integrity of the
document structure.

        This method is called when a node does not have a specialized handler.
        Subclasses can override this method to provide default behavior or logging
