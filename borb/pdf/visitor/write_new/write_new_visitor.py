"""
Represents the base class for visitor objects that traverse and write or persist a PDF document structure.

This class inherits from `NodeVisitor` and serves as a foundation for specialized
visitor classes that handle writing operations for different parts of a PDF (e.g., pages,
text, images, annotations). It provides a framework for persisting the structure by
traversing the nodes of a PDF document tree.

The separation of writing operations from the PDF components allows for easy extension
or modification through subclasses tailored to specific node types.
