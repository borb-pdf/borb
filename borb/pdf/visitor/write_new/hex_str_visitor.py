"""
A visitor class for handling the writing or processing of string objects within the PDF structure.

The `StrVisitor` class is responsible for traversing and processing nodes that contain string
values in the PDF document tree. It ensures that string objects are correctly written or exported,
handling the necessary formatting, encoding, and any specific PDF string-related requirements.

This class inherits from the `WriteNewVisitor` class and focuses on processing string nodes in a
manner consistent with the PDF standard.

        This method is called when a node does not have a specialized handler.
