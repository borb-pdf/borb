"""
Abstract base class for implementing the Visitor pattern in PDF structure traversal.

The `NodeVisitor` class serves as a superclass for various concrete visitor
implementations that traverse the PDF document structure. This class defines
the interface and common functionality for visitors, enabling them to process
different types of nodes (e.g., pages, images, text) within the PDF hierarchy.
By utilizing the Visitor pattern, this design promotes separation of concerns,
allowing for operations such as reading, writing, or manipulating the PDF content
without modifying the node classes themselves.

        This method is called when a node does not have a specialized handler.
        Subclasses can override this method to provide default behavior or logging
        for unsupported nodes. If any operation is performed on the node (e.g.,
