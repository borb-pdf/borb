"""
A visitor class responsible for navigating and interpreting the cross-reference (XRef) table  and trailer information in a PDF file.

The `XRefVisitor` class is designed to traverse and extract data related to the structure of a
PDF file’s cross-reference table, which maintains a directory of all objects within the file.
This visitor reads object numbers, byte offsets, and generation numbers, enabling efficient
access to each object’s position in the file. The visitor also processes the trailer dictionary,
which includes information about the document structure, such as the root object, encryption
status, and file size metadata.

`XRefVisitor` serves as a base class for specialized xref-related visitors, such as those
that handle compressed xref streams or particular cross-reference formats. It can be
extended to implement specific reading strategies or custom xref processing behaviors,
supporting robust and optimized PDF parsing.
