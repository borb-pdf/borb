"""
The `RecursiveReferenceVisitor` class: Resolves references in a PDF document post-construction.

The `RecursiveReferenceVisitor` is a specialized visitor that traverses a built PDF document
to resolve references recursively. This approach addresses the challenge of resolving references
during the document-building phase, which may result in cyclical dependencies or incomplete references.

By deferring the resolution of references to post-construction, this visitor ensures that all
objects in the document are fully initialized and that references can be resolved without causing
infinite loops or errors.

This visitor is typically used to finalize a PDF document, ensuring that all indirect references
are replaced with their corresponding objects for accurate rendering or processing.
