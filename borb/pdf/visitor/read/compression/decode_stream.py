"""
PDF Stream Decoder Module.

This module provides functionality for decoding compressed PDF `stream` objects,
applying the appropriate decompression filters specified in each stream's `Filter` entry.

PDF streams may use various encoding methods to reduce file size, including but not
limited to:
- **FlateDecode** (zlib or DEFLATE-based compression)
- **ASCII85Decode** (ASCII base-85 encoding)
- **LZWDecode** (LZW compression, used in image data and other highly repetitive content)
- **RunLengthDecode** (Run-length encoding, suitable for monochrome images or data with long runs of single-byte values)

The `decode_stream` function in this module detects and applies these filters, allowing
compressed data within the PDF to be decoded for processing, rendering, or other uses.
If multiple filters are applied to a stream, `decode_stream` processes them sequentially
in the order they are listed.

    Decode a PDF `stream` object, applying compression filters specified in the stream's `Filter` entry.

    This function takes a PDF `stream` object that may be encoded with various
    compression algorithms (such as Flate, ASCII85, LZW, or Run-Length encoding),
    decodes the `Bytes` content within the stream, and stores the resulting uncompressed
    content under the `DecodedBytes` entry in the stream dictionary.

    If the stream is already decoded (has a `DecodedBytes` entry), the function returns
    immediately without further processing.

                entry, ready for uncompressed access.
