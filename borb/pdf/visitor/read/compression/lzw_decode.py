"""
A class to handle LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) compression decoding in the context of PDF data.

LZW is a lossless data compression algorithm that is used in various contexts, including PDF image
compression. This class provides functionality to decode data that has been compressed using LZW,
which is commonly used for handling image data and other compressed content in a PDF file.

The decoding process involves reversing the LZW encoding algorithm to restore the original, uncompressed
data from the encoded byte sequence. This class can be used for handling compressed data streams
within a PDF document, including but not limited to image streams, object data, and other binary content.
