"""
Visitor class for reading and parsing name objects in a PDF byte stream.

`NameVisitor` extends `ReadVisitor` to identify and process name objects within
a PDF, converting these into corresponding Python strings. Using the visitor pattern,
`NameVisitor` traverses PDF nodes and extracts name objects according to the PDF
specification, facilitating structured parsing of named resources and keys.

        This method is called when a node does not have a specialized handler.
        Subclasses can override this method to provide default behavior or logging
        for unsupported nodes. If any operation is performed on the node (e.g.,
