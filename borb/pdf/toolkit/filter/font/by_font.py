A filter class for processing PDF page content streams, specifically targeting content  associated with a specified font type.

This filter identifies and processes text elements rendered using a particular font,
allowing selective extraction, manipulation, or analysis based on font style, family,
or name. `ByFont` is especially useful in cases where different fonts in a document
denote different types of information, such as headings, footnotes, or emphasized text.
