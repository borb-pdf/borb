"""
A filter class for processing PDF page content streams, specifically targeting content that appears within a specified rectangular region on the PDF page.

The `Inside` filter identifies and processes elements located within a defined area, allowing
for selective extraction or manipulation of text, images, or graphics within that region. This
filter is useful for isolating content within specific boundaries, such as tables, headers,
footers, or highlighted sections.
