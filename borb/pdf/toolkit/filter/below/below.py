"""
A filter class for processing PDF page content streams, specifically targeting content that appears below a specified y-coordinate on the PDF page.

This class is part of a filtering system designed to handle and manipulate portions
of a PDF content stream based on their vertical position. Using `Below`, only
content located beneath the given y-coordinate threshold is targeted, allowing for
selective manipulation or extraction of content positioned lower on the page.
