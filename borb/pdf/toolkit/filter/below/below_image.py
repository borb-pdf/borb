"""
A filter class for processing PDF page content streams, specifically targeting content that appears below a specified image on the PDF page.

This filter is used to identify and process elements, typically text, that are positioned
beneath a designated image within the content stream. By setting an image as a
reference point, `BelowImage` enables selective extraction, manipulation, or analysis
of content that appears below that image, making it useful for document processing tasks
that depend on spatial relationships between images and surrounding text.
