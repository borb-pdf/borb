"""
A filter class for processing PDF page content streams, specifically targeting content that appears below a specified text reference on the PDF page.

This filter identifies and processes elements, typically text or images, that are
positioned beneath a designated text phrase or string within the content stream.
By setting a reference text, `BelowText` allows selective extraction, manipulation,
or analysis of content appearing below that text. This is particularly useful in
document workflows where spatial relationships relative to text references are significant.
