"""
A filter class for processing PDF content streams, targeting content positioned above a specified y-coordinate on the page.

The `Above` class extends `PageContentStreamFilter` and is used to filter and modify
page content streams based on vertical positioning, allowing only the content above a
specified threshold (typically a y-coordinate) to be retained in the filtered stream.

This functionality is useful for applications that need to analyze or manipulate portions
of the page content based on layout requirements. For example, extracting header sections,
content above a certain y-coordinate, or portions of text/images that appear in the
upper part of a page.
