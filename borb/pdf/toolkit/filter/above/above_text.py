"""
A filter class for processing PDF page content streams to retain content positioned visually above a specified text element on the page.

`AboveText` extends `PageContentStreamFilter` to provide targeted filtering of
content that appears above a specified text (e.g., "Lorem Ipsum") in the document's
content stream. This can be useful in document processing tasks where context-specific
content separation is needed, such as extracting headers, annotations, or images
that are positioned above specific keywords or phrases.
