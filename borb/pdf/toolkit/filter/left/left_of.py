"""
A filter class for processing PDF page content streams, specifically targeting content that appears to the left of a specified coordinate on the PDF page.

The `LeftOf` filter identifies and processes elements that are located to the left of
a defined x-coordinate threshold. This can be useful for extracting or manipulating content
within a specific horizontal region of the page, such as filtering out text or objects that
appear to the left of a particular point.
