A processing pipe that forwards events only for dd-numbered pages in a PDF.

This class extends the `Pipe` class and filters events based on the page number.
If the page associated with the event is odd-numbered, the event is forwarded to the next pipe in the processing chain.
Otherwise, the event is discarded.
