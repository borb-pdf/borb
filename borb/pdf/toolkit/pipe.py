"""
A class representing a pipeline component for processing events.

The `Pipe` class is part of a chain-of-responsibility pattern where each `Pipe`
instance processes an `Event` object and optionally forwards it to the next
component in the chain. This modular design allows for flexible event processing,
where each step in the pipeline can handle or modify the event as needed.

The `Pipe` can be extended to implement custom behavior by overriding the `process`
method. It also supports chaining through the `set_next` method, enabling seamless
linking of multiple processing steps.
