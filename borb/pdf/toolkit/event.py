"""
A generic class representing an event in the PDF processing pipeline.

The `Event` class serves as a base class for various events that occur during the
rendering or processing of content within a PDF document. These events may include
actions such as shapes being stroked or filled, images being rendered, and text
being rendered. This class is designed to be extended for specific event types,
allowing for flexible and extensible handling of PDF content.

The `Event` class provides a structure for representing the details of these actions,
enabling downstream processes in the pipeline to react accordingly. As the PDF processing
framework evolves, this class can be further extended to accommodate new event types,
making it a scalable foundation for handling various content rendering operations.

Current event types include:
- ShapeStrokeEvent: Represents the event when a shape is stroked.
- ShapeFillEvent: Represents the event when a shape is filled.
- ImageEvent: Represents the event when an image is rendered.
- TextEvent: Represents the event when text is rendered.

The flexibility of this class allows for new event types to be added in the future as
needed, facilitating ongoing expansion and customization of the PDF processing pipeline.
