The 'f' operator: Fill the current path.

This operator fills the current path using the nonzero winding number rule,
determining the regions to be painted. Before filling, any open subpaths in
the path are implicitly closed.

The nonzero winding number rule considers the direction in which the path
is drawn to determine the regions to fill. See section 8.5.3.3.2, "Nonzero Winding
