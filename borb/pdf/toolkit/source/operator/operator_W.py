The 'W' operator: Modify the current clipping path using the nonzero winding number rule.

This operator updates the current clipping path by intersecting it with the current path.
The regions inside the new clipping path are determined based on the nonzero winding
number rule. This rule calculates whether a point is inside a path by counting the
number of times the path winds around the point.
