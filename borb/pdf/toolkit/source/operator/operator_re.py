"""
The 're' operator: Append a rectangle to the current path.

This operator appends a rectangle to the current path as a complete subpath.
The rectangle is defined by its lower-left corner at coordinates (x, y),
with the specified width and height, all in user space coordinates.

The operation `x y width height re` is equivalent to the following sequence:
    - Move to (x, y) with the 'm' operator.
    - Draw a line to (x + width, y) with the 'l' operator.
    - Draw a line to (x + width, y + height) with the 'l' operator.
    - Draw a line to (x, y + height) with the 'l' operator.
    - Close the subpath with the 'h' operator.

This operator is commonly used to create rectangular shapes within a path for
subsequent filling, stroking, or clipping operations.

Note:
    This operator creates a closed subpath representing a rectangle. If the rectangle
    needs to be filled, stroked, or clipped, additional operators such as 'f', 'S', or 'n'
    should follow.
