"""
The 'BMC' operator: Begin a marked-content sequence terminated by a balancing 'EMC' operator.

The 'BMC' operator is used to begin a marked-content sequence in a PDF content stream.
The sequence is terminated by the 'EMC' (End Marked Content) operator, which balances
the 'BMC' operator. The 'tag' parameter, passed as a name object, indicates the role
or significance of the marked-content sequence.

Marked-content sequences are used to associate metadata or other relevant information
with specific content in the document. This can include annotations, tags for accessibility,
or other document-specific data.

Note:
    Marked-content sequences allow for better structure and accessibility in PDF documents.
    The 'tag' is typically used to identify the nature of the content, and the sequence
    can be used to apply properties or metadata to the content within the sequence.
