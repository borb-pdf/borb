"""
The 'cs' operator: Set the current colour space for nonstroking operations.

The 'cs' operator is used to set the current colour space for nonstroking operations in a PDF content stream.
The operand for this operator is a name object that specifies the colour space. Similar to the 'CS' operator,
if the colour space is one of the predefined ones (such as DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, or certain cases
of Pattern), the name may be specified directly. Otherwise, the name corresponds to an entry in the ColorSpace
subdictionary of the current resource dictionary, where the associated value describes the colour space.

The operator also resets the current nonstroking colour to its initial value, which depends on the chosen colour space:
    - For DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, CalGray, or CalRGB, the initial colour has all components equal to 0.0.
    - For DeviceCMYK, the initial colour is [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0].
    - For Lab or ICCBased colour spaces, the initial colour components are set to 0.0, unless that falls outside
      the defined range, in which case the nearest valid value is used.
    - For Indexed colour spaces, the initial colour is set to 0.
    - For Separation or DeviceN colour spaces, the initial tint value is 1.0 for all colorants.
    - For Pattern colour spaces, the initial colour is a pattern object that causes nothing to be painted.

Note:
    For more details on colour spaces and the initial colour values, refer to PDF specification section 7.8.3,
    "Resource Dictionaries," and section 8.6.3, "Colour Space Families."
