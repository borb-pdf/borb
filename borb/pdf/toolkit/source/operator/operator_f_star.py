The 'f*' operator: Fill the current path using the even-odd rule.

This operator fills the current path using the even-odd rule to determine the
regions to be painted. The even-odd rule defines a region as filled if a ray
drawn from any point within the region to infinity crosses the path an odd number
of times.

See section 8.5.3.3.3, "Even-Odd Rule," in the PDF specification for more details.
