"""
The 'J' operator: Set the line cap style in the graphics state.

This operator sets the line cap style for stroking operations in a PDF content stream.
The line cap style determines how the ends of a stroked path are rendered.
The value of the operand specifies the cap style, which can be one of the following:

- 0: Butt cap (the stroke ends at the path's endpoint)
- 1: Round cap (a semicircular cap extends beyond the endpoint)
- 2: Square cap (a square cap extends beyond the endpoint)

The line cap style influences how paths are drawn and can impact the appearance of
closed shapes or paths with sharp corners.

See PDF specification section 8.4.3.3, "Line Cap Style" for more details.
