"""
The 'TJ' operator: Show one or more text strings, allowing individual glyph positioning.

This operator displays one or more text strings, with the option to adjust the
position of each string (or individual glyphs) relative to the previous one. The
operand for this operator is an array of strings and/or numbers. Each element of
the array can be either a string (representing the text to be displayed) or a number
(representing an adjustment to the current text position).

If the element is a string, it is shown at the current text position. If the element
is a number, the text position is adjusted by that amount. The number is expressed
in thousandths of a unit of text space, meaning the adjustment is made in text space units,
and the value is subtracted from the current coordinate depending on the writing mode.

The effect of a positive number is to move the next glyph either to the left (in horizontal writing mode)
or down (in vertical writing mode).

Example:
    - ['Hello ', 10, 'World'] would display the string 'Hello' at the current position,
      adjust the position by 10 units, and then display 'World' at the new position.

Note:
    - The operator allows fine control over glyph positioning within the text string.
    - The operands in the array are processed sequentially, applying any positional
      adjustments between the glyphs.
