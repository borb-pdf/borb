"""
The 'Ts' operator: Set text rise.

This operator sets the text rise in the current text state, which is the amount
by which the text is displaced vertically from its baseline. The text rise is typically
used to adjust the vertical position of the text, allowing for raised or lowered text
relative to its normal position.

The operand for this operator is a numeric value that specifies the vertical offset
(rise) in user space. A positive value moves the text upward, while a negative value
moves the text downward.

Note:
    - The text rise value affects all subsequent text show operations until it is changed
      by another 'Ts' operator.
    - This operator does not affect the position of other graphic objects or the text baseline.
