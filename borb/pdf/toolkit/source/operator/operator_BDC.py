"""
The 'BDC' operator: Begin a marked-content sequence with an associated property list.

The 'BDC' operator is used to begin a marked-content sequence in a PDF content stream,
with an associated property list. The operator is followed by a tag (a name object that
indicates the role or significance of the sequence) and a properties list (which can either
be an inline dictionary or a name object associated with the property list in the Properties
subdictionary of the current resource dictionary).

The marked-content sequence is terminated by a balancing 'EMC' operator.

Note:
    The 'tag' argument specifies the role or significance of the marked-content sequence.
    The 'properties' argument can either be a dictionary containing the property list or a
    name object referring to it in the current resource dictionary. For more details, refer to
    section 14.6.2, "Property Lists" of the PDF specification.
