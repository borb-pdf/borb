"""
The 'B' operator: Fill and then stroke the path using the nonzero winding number rule.

The 'B' operator is used in a PDF content stream to fill and then stroke a path.
The filling portion of the operation uses the nonzero winding number rule to determine
the region to fill, ensuring that areas enclosed by the path are properly processed.

The 'B' operator produces the same result as constructing two identical path objects,
painting the first with the 'f' operator (fill) and the second with the 'S' operator (stroke).

Note:
    The filling and stroking portions of this operation consult different values of
    several graphics state parameters, such as the current color. Refer to PDF specification
    section 11.7.4.4, "Special Path-Painting Considerations," for more details on these interactions.
