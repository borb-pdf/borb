"""
The 'M' operator: Set the miter limit in the graphics state.

This operator sets the miter limit in the graphics state, which controls how the intersection of two connected
path segments is joined when the line join style is set to miter. The miter limit defines the maximum allowed
length for the miter (the sharp point at the intersection of two path segments). If the miter exceeds this limit,
the line join is automatically converted to a bevel join.

The operand specifies the miter limit value, which is a positive number.

The miter limit is used when the line join style is set to "miter" (using the `j` operator) and affects how sharp
the corners are when two lines meet at an angle.
