"""
The 'sc' operator: Set the stroke color using the current color space.

The 'sc' operator is used in a PDF content stream to set the stroke color for subsequent
path operations. The color is specified using the current color space, which could be
either a device-dependent color space (e.g., RGB or CMYK) or a device-independent color
space (e.g., CIE-based color spaces). The 'sc' operator applies to the stroke color,
which is used when paths are stroked with the 'S' operator or similar.

The color values provided are based on the current color space in effect, and the operator
expects the correct number of parameters based on the type of color space (e.g., 1 for grayscale,
3 for RGB, or 4 for CMYK).

Note:
    The 'sc' operator only affects the stroke color and does not impact fill operations.
    The color set by this operator is stored in the graphics state and remains in effect
    until it is changed by another color operator (e.g., 'scn' for stroke color with a specified
    color space, 'rg' for fill color, etc.). For more information on the graphics state and color
    management in PDF, refer to section 4.5 of the PDF specification.
