"""
The 'W*' operator: Modify the current clipping path using the even-odd rule.

This operator modifies the current clipping path by intersecting it with the current
path. The even-odd rule is used to determine which regions of the current path are
considered inside the clipping path.

Note:
    - The even-odd rule counts the number of times a path crosses a line extending
      to infinity from a given point. If the count is odd, the point is inside the path.
    - The current path is cleared after the clipping path is modified.
