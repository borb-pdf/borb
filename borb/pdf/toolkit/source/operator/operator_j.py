"""
The 'j' operator: Set the line join style in the graphics state.

This operator sets the line join style for stroking operations in a PDF content stream.
The line join style determines how the junctions between two connected path segments
are rendered. The value of the operand specifies the join style, which can be one of the following:

- 0: Miter join (sharp corner at the junction)
- 1: Round join (a circular arc is drawn at the junction)
- 2: Bevel join (the junction is flattened at the corner)

The line join style impacts how the appearance of corners or angles between path segments is rendered.

See PDF specification section 8.4.3.4, "Line Join Style" for more details.
