"""
The 'MP' operator: Designate a marked-content point with an associated tag.

This operator is used to designate a marked-content point in a PDF content stream. The 'tag' parameter
specifies the role or significance of the marked-content point and is represented as a name object.

Marked-content sequences are used to organize and tag content for purposes such as extracting,
filtering, or manipulating specific portions of the document. The 'MP' operator is typically used
in conjunction with other marked-content operators like 'BMC' (Begin Marked-Content) and 'EMC' (End Marked-Content)
to delineate content within the document.
