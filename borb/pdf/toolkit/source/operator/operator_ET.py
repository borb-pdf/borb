"""
The 'ET' operator: End a text object.

The 'ET' operator is used in a PDF content stream to signify the end of a text object.
It terminates the current text object and discards the associated text matrix (Tm) and
text line matrix (Tlm), resetting the text state.

Text objects are initialized with the 'BT' (Begin Text) operator and represent sequences
of text-related operations. Once 'ET' is called, the text-specific state is cleared, and
the content stream continues with other graphics or text operations.
