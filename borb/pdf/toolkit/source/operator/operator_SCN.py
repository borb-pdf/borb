"""
The 'SCN' operator: Set the color for stroking operations, supporting additional color spaces.

This operator functions like the 'SC' operator but also supports Pattern, Separation,
DeviceN, and ICCBased color spaces. The number of operands and their interpretation
depend on the current stroking color space.

If the current stroking color space is:

- **Separation**, **DeviceN**, or **ICCBased**: The operands (c1…cn) are numbers, and
  the number of operands varies depending on the color space.
- **Pattern color space**: The operand is the name of an entry in the Pattern subdictionary
  of the current resource dictionary. For an uncolored tiling pattern (PatternType = 1,
  PaintType = 2), the operands (c1…cn) specify a color in the pattern’s underlying color space.
  For other types of patterns, no operands are specified.

The operator sets the color for stroking operations, affecting the current graphics state.

Note:
    The behavior of this operator is influenced by the specifics of the stroking
    color space, which can vary significantly in terms of operands and their meanings.
