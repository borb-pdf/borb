"""
The 'EX' operator: End a compatibility section.

The 'EX' operator is used in a PDF content stream to terminate a compatibility section
that was begun by a matching 'BX' operator. Compatibility sections allow unrecognized
operators and operands to be ignored without causing errors.

Once 'EX' is encountered, the compatibility mode ends, and normal processing of
the content stream resumes.

Note:
    This operator is available starting from PDF 1.1.
