"""
The 'sh' operator: Paint the shape and color shading described by a shading dictionary.

This operator paints the shape and color shading described by a shading dictionary,
subject to the current clipping path. Unlike other operators, the current color in
the graphics state is neither used nor altered during this operation.

The operand 'name' refers to the name of a shading dictionary resource in the Shading
subdictionary of the current resource dictionary. All coordinates in the shading dictionary
are interpreted relative to the current user space. If used within a type 2 pattern, the
coordinates would be in pattern space instead. The colors in the shading dictionary are
interpreted in the color space identified by the dictionary’s `ColorSpace` entry, while the
`Background` entry, if present, is ignored.

Note:
    This operator should be applied only to bounded or geometrically defined shadings.
    If applied to an unbounded shading, the shading’s gradient fill will be painted across
    the entire clipping region, which could be time-consuming.
