"""
Represents a generic superclass for PDF operators.

Operators in a PDF content stream define specific actions or transformations
that modify the appearance or content of a PDF page. Examples include setting
text properties, drawing graphics, or manipulating the graphics state.

The `Operator` class provides a base structure for implementing various PDF operators,
including methods for retrieving the operator's name, determining the number of
expected operands, and applying the operator's logic.

Subclasses should override the `apply` method to implement the specific behavior of
each operator.
