"""
The 'EMC' operator: End a marked-content sequence.

The 'EMC' operator is used in a PDF content stream to mark the end of a marked-content sequence that was initiated
by either the 'BMC' (Begin Marked-Content) or 'BDC' (Begin Marked-Content with Property List) operator.

This operator signals the closure of the marked-content sequence,
and it ensures that the content between the 'BMC'/'BDC' and 'EMC' operators is properly associated with the specified tag
and properties (if any). The 'EMC' operator is typically used to delineate sections of content that can be treated as a unit for processing,
such as a group of related graphical elements or annotations.

It is important to note that 'EMC' does not affect the graphics state or the flow of content in the document;
it simply marks the end of the tagged content sequence.
