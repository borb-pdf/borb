"""
The 'k' operator: Set the color space to DeviceCMYK for nonstroking operations and set the color for nonstroking operations.

This operator sets the color space for nonstroking operations to DeviceCMYK (or DefaultCMYK) and specifies
the color to use for nonstroking operations such as filling paths. The four operands represent the CMYK components
of the color, where each value is between 0.0 (zero concentration) and 1.0 (maximum concentration). The four operands correspond to:

- C: Cyan
- M: Magenta
- Y: Yellow
- K: Black (Key)

The behavior of this operator is also influenced by the current overprint mode (see section 8.6.7, "Overprint Control").

This operator ensures that the specified color is used for nonstroking operations like filling paths in the PDF content stream,
affecting how paths are painted with the given CMYK color.

See PDF specification section 8.6.5.6, "Default Color Spaces" for more details.
