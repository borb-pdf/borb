"""
The 'h' operator: Close the current subpath.

This operator closes the current subpath by appending a straight line segment from the
current point to the starting point of the subpath. If the subpath is already closed,
the operator does nothing.

Notes:
    - The 'h' operator terminates the current subpath. Any subsequent segment added
      to the path will start a new subpath, even if it begins at the endpoint reached
      by the 'h' operation.
    - This operator is useful for completing shapes without explicitly drawing the
      closing line segment.

Refer to the PDF specification for further details on path construction and the
role of subpaths.
