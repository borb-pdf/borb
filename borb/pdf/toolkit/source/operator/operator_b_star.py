"""
The 'b*' operator: Close, fill, and then stroke the path using the even-odd rule.

The 'b*' operator is used in a PDF content stream to close the current path, fill it
using the even-odd rule, and then stroke the path. The even-odd rule determines the
region to fill by considering a point inside the path if it is crossed by an odd number
of path segments.

The 'b*' operator has the same effect as the sequence `h B*`, where `h` closes the
current path and `B*` fills and strokes it using the even-odd rule.

Note:
    The filling and stroking portions of this operation consult different values of
    several graphics state parameters, such as the current color. Refer to PDF
    specification section 11.7.4.4, "Special Path-Painting Considerations," for
    additional details on these interactions.
