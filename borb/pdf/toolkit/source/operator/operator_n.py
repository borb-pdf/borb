"""
The 'n' operator: End the path without filling or stroking.

This operator is used to end a path object without performing any fill or stroke operations.
It is primarily used for the side effect of changing the current clipping path.

When this operator is used, the current path is closed without any modification to the
path's appearance. However, it can affect the current clipping path, which is used to
determine the visible area when rendering subsequent content.

The 'n' operator is typically used in conjunction with other path construction operators
to define complex clipping regions, and its primary role is in the context of clipping
path operations.
