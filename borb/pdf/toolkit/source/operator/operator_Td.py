"""
The 'Td' operator: Move to the start of the next line, offset by (tx, ty).

This operator moves the current text position by the specified horizontal (tx)
and vertical (ty) distances in unscaled text space units. The operands tx and ty
are values in the current text space, and they represent the offset from the
current text position to the next starting point of the text.

The effect of this operator is to displace the text position horizontally by tx
and vertically by ty. It does not modify the text leading (vertical spacing between
lines of text), unlike the 'TD' operator, which sets the leading as well.

Note:
    Both tx and ty are measured in unscaled text space units, meaning they are
    subject to the current text scaling factors in effect. The text position is
    then updated accordingly.
