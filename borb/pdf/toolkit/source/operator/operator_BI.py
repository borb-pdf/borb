"""
The 'BI' operator: Begin an inline image object.

The 'BI' operator is used to start an inline image object in a PDF content stream.
It marks the beginning of the data for an inline image that will be embedded directly
in the content stream. The inline image data is typically followed by an associated
dictionary describing the image's properties, such as width, height, color space, etc.

The inline image data is terminated by the 'EI' operator, which marks the end of the inline image.

Note:
    This operator is used in cases where the image data is included directly within
    the content stream, as opposed to being referenced externally.
