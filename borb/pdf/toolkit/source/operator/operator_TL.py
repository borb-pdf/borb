"""
The 'TL' operator: Set text leading.

This operator sets the text leading parameter in the text state. Text leading determines
the vertical spacing between lines of text and is expressed in unscaled text space units.
It affects the position of the next line when the 'T*' operator or equivalent operations
are used.

Note:
    - Text leading is a key parameter in managing text layout, especially for multi-line
      text rendering.
    - The value set by this operator persists in the text state until explicitly changed.
