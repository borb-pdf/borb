"""
The 'y' operator: Append a cubic Bézier curve to the current path.

The 'y' operator is used in a PDF content stream to append a cubic Bézier curve to the
current path. The curve extends from the current point to the point (x3, y3), with the
control points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) defining the shape of the curve. After executing the
'yc' operator, the new current point is set to (x3, y3), which is the endpoint of the curve.

This operator is part of the path construction process, allowing for the creation of
smooth, curved paths in a PDF document. Cubic Bézier curves are widely used for defining
complex shapes and curves in vector graphics, providing precise control over the curvature.

Note:
    The 'y' operator is similar to the 'c' operator, which also appends a cubic Bézier
    curve to the path, but the 'y' operator requires different control points. The
    'y' operator modifies the current point to the final endpoint of the curve.
    For more information on Bézier curves, refer to section 8.5.2.2 of the PDF specification.
