"""
The 'scn' operator: Set the color for nonstroking operations in special color spaces (ICCBased, Separation, DeviceN, and Pattern).

This operator sets the current color for nonstroking operations in advanced color spaces, including ICCBased,
Separation, DeviceN, and Pattern. The number and interpretation of the operands depend on the current nonstroking
color space:

- For Separation, DeviceN, or ICCBased color spaces, the operands (c1...cn) are numbers that specify the
  color components.
- For Pattern color spaces, the first operand is a name (representing an entry in the Pattern subdictionary of the
  current resource dictionary). If the pattern is uncolored (PatternType = 1 and PaintType = 2), additional operands
  specify the color in the pattern’s underlying color space.

The 'scn' operator updates the nonstroking color in the current graphics state and is used for filling paths,
shapes, or any other graphical elements that require special color handling.

Note:
    - The 'scn' operator is versatile and supports color spaces beyond the standard Device color spaces (RGB, CMYK, and Gray).
    - For stroking operations in these advanced color spaces, use the 'SCN' operator.

        Initialize the 'scn' operator.

        This operator requires access to the active rendering Source because
        the number and interpretation of operands depend on the currently
        selected non-stroking color space in the graphics state.

        The Source instance provides access to:
        - The current graphics state
        - The active non-stroking color space
        - Validation context for operand count and color component semantics

        Since the 'scn' operator does not explicitly specify a color space
        (it uses the one already set in the graphics state), it must query
        the Source at execution time to determine how many operands are
        expected (e.g., 1 for DeviceGray, 3 for DeviceRGB, 4 for DeviceCMYK,
        or a color-space-defined component count for other spaces).
