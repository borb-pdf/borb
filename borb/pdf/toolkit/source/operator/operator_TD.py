"""
The 'TD' operator: Move to the start of the next line, offset by (tx, ty).

This operator moves the current text position to a new location, offset from the
current position by the specified horizontal (tx) and vertical (ty) distances.
Additionally, it sets the leading (vertical spacing between lines of text) to the
value of ty.

This operator is equivalent to executing the following two operators in sequence:
    - -ty TL  (sets the leading to -ty)
    - tx ty Td (moves the text position by tx, ty)

Note:
    The horizontal movement (tx) and vertical movement (ty) specify the displacement
    from the current text position, allowing for precise control over text placement.
