"""
The 'Tr' operator: Set text rendering mode.

This operator sets the text rendering mode in the current graphics state, determining
how text is rendered. The rendering mode specifies whether the text is filled, stroked,
or both. It also controls whether the text is clipped.

The valid values for the rendering mode are:
    - 0: Fill text (default mode).
    - 1: Stroke text (outline the text).
    - 2: Fill and stroke text (both fill and outline the text).
    - 3: Fill text and add text clipping path.
    - 4: Stroke text and add text clipping path.
    - 5: Fill, stroke, and add text clipping path.

Note:
    - This operator affects only the rendering of text and does not affect other graphical elements.
    - The `Tr` operator is typically used to create effects such as outlining, filling, or clipping text
      based on its path.
