"""
The 'cm' operator: Modify the current transformation matrix (CTM).

The 'cm' operator is used to modify the current transformation matrix (CTM) by concatenating
it with the specified matrix. The operands of this operator are six numbers that represent
the matrix to be concatenated with the current CTM (not an array).

This operator allows for transformations of the coordinate system, such as scaling, rotation,
and translation, as described in PDF specification section 8.3.2, "Coordinate Spaces".

The six operands are provided in the following order:
    - a, b, c, d: The elements of the 2x2 transformation matrix.
    - e, f: The translation components of the transformation.

After the operator is executed, the CTM is updated to reflect the transformation.

Note:
    Refer to PDF specification section 8.3.2, "Coordinate Spaces", for more information
    on how coordinate transformations are applied in PDF graphics.
