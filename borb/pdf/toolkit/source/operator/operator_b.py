"""
The 'b' operator: Close, fill, and then stroke the path using the nonzero winding number rule.

The 'b' operator is used in a PDF content stream to close the current path, fill it,
and then stroke it. The filling portion of the operation uses the nonzero winding
number rule to determine the region to fill, ensuring that the enclosed areas are properly processed.

The 'b' operator has the same effect as the sequence `h B`, where `h` closes
the path and `B` fills and strokes it.

Note:
    The filling and stroking portions of this operation consult different values of
    several graphics state parameters, such as the current color. Refer to PDF
    specification section 11.7.4.4, "Special Path-Painting Considerations," for
    additional details on these interactions.
