The 'Tz' operator: Set horizontal text scaling.

This operator adjusts the horizontal scaling of text by modifying the spacing between
glyphs. The scaling factor is specified as a percentage, where 100 means no scaling,
values greater than 100 expand the text horizontally, and values less than 100
compress it.
