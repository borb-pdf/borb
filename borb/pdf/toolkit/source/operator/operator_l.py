"""
The 'l' operator: Append a straight line segment from the current point to the specified point.

This operator appends a straight line segment to the current path, extending from the current point to a new point
specified by the operands (x, y). After executing this operator, the current point is updated to the new point (x, y).

The operands (x, y) specify the coordinates of the endpoint of the line segment to be added.

This operator is commonly used to build paths incrementally by adding straight line segments, helping to create
more complex shapes when multiple line segments are connected.
