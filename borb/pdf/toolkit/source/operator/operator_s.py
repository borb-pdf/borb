"""
The 's' operator: Close and stroke the path.

This operator is used to close the current subpath by appending a straight line
segment from the current point to the starting point of the subpath and then
strokes the resulting path. If the current subpath is already closed, the operator
simply strokes the path.

This operator has the same effect as executing the sequence 'h S', where 'h' closes
the current subpath, and 'S' strokes the path.

Note:
    The behavior of this operator depends on the current graphics state parameters,
    such as the current line width, color, and dash pattern.
