"""
The 'd1' operator: Set width and bounding box information for the glyph and declare that the glyph description specifies only shape, not colour.

The 'd1' operator is used in Type 3 fonts within a PDF content stream to define the width and bounding box of a glyph,
and to indicate that the glyph description specifies only the shape of the glyph, not its colour. Specifically, the
operator sets the horizontal displacement (wx) of the glyph in the glyph coordinate system, which must be consistent
with the corresponding width in the font's Widths array, while the vertical displacement (wy) is set to 0.

In addition to width information, this operator also defines the bounding box for the glyph, specified by the lower-left
corner (llx, lly) and the upper-right corner (urx, ury). This bounding box should be large enough to enclose the entire
glyph, including any marks that result from executing the glyph's description. If the bounding box is too small and marks
fall outside of it, the result is unpredictable.

This operator is used when the glyph's colour is determined by the graphics state and not specified within the glyph's
description. As such, the glyph description should not execute any operators that set colour or colour-related parameters;
any such operators will be ignored. Additionally, the glyph description should not include an image, though an image mask
is acceptable.

This operator must only be used in a content stream found in a Type 3 font's CharProcs dictionary.

Note:
    - The 'd1' operator name ends with the digit '1', distinguishing it from the 'd0' operator.
    - The bounding box must be large enough to fully enclose the glyph. If marks fall outside this box, the result is unpredictable.
    - For more details on glyph positioning and metrics, refer to PDF specification section 9.2.4, "Glyph Positioning and Metrics."
