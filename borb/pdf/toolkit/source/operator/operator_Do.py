"""
The 'Do' operator: Paint the specified XObject.

The 'Do' operator is used in a PDF content stream to paint an XObject (external object), which could be an image, a form, or a PostScript object.
The operand of this operator is the name of the XObject, which must be a key in the XObject subdictionary of the current resource dictionary.

The associated value for this key in the resource dictionary must be a stream whose `Type` entry, if present, is set to `XObject`.
The specific behavior of the operator depends on the value of the XObject’s `Subtype` entry, which can take one of the following values:

- **Image**: Refers to an image XObject (for details, see section 8.9.5, "Image Dictionaries").
- **Form**: Refers to a form XObject, which represents a reusable graphical object or group of objects (for details, see section 8.10, "Form XObjects").
- **PS (PostScript)**: Refers to a PostScript XObject, which represents PostScript code to be executed (for details, see section 8.8.2, "PostScript XObjects").

The effect of the 'Do' operator depends on the `Subtype` of the XObject, as it determines the type of content that will be rendered on the page.

For more information about XObjects and how they are used, refer to section 7.8.3, "Resource Dictionaries," and the appropriate sections on XObject types (Image, Form, and PostScript).
