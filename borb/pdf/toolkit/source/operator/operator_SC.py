"""
The 'SC' operator: Set the color for stroking operations in a device, CIE-based, or Indexed color space.

This operator sets the color to use for stroking paths, depending on the current
stroking color space. The number of operands required and their interpretation
varies based on the specific color space in use:

- For DeviceGray, CalGray, and Indexed color spaces, one operand is required.
- For DeviceRGB, CalRGB, and Lab color spaces, three operands are required.
- For DeviceCMYK color space, four operands are required.

The operands represent the components of the color in the corresponding color space.
For example, in DeviceRGB, the three operands represent the red, green, and blue components.

Note:
    This operator applies only to stroking operations and will not affect non-stroking
    color or other graphics state parameters.
