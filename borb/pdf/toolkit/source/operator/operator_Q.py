"""
The 'Q' operator: Restore the graphics state.

This operator is used to restore the graphics state by removing the most recently saved
state from the graphics state stack and making it the current state. It effectively undoes
any changes made to the graphics state since the last 'q' operator was executed.

The graphics state includes various parameters such as the current transformation matrix,
the current color, line width, line cap style, and other drawing parameters. By using 'Q',
the system reverts to the state that was in effect at the time of the last 'q' operation,
ensuring that any changes made since that point are undone.

This operator is part of the graphics state stack mechanism, allowing for the temporary
modification of the graphics state during drawing operations, with the ability to revert to
a prior state when necessary.
