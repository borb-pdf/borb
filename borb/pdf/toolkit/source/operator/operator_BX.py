"""
The 'BX' operator: Begin a compatibility section.

The 'BX' (Begin Compatibility) operator is used to start a compatibility section in a PDF
content stream. This section allows the inclusion of unrecognized operators and their operands,
which will be ignored without generating errors until the balancing 'EX' operator is encountered.
This feature is particularly useful for backward compatibility with older versions of PDF.

Note:
    The operators and operands in the compatibility section will not affect the rendering
    of the page or other operations until the 'EX' operator is encountered, which ends
    the compatibility section.
