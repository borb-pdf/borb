"""
The 'rg' operator: Set the nonstroking color using the DeviceRGB color space.

This operator sets the nonstroking color in the graphics state by specifying
a color using the DeviceRGB color space (or the DefaultRGB color space, as defined
in the PDF specification). The color is defined by three operands, each representing
a component of the color: red, green, and blue. Each component is a number between
0.0 (minimum intensity) and 1.0 (maximum intensity).

This operator is functionally equivalent to 'RG', but it is used specifically
for nonstroking operations (such as filling or text rendering).

Note:
    The values provided for red, green, and blue should be in the range [0.0, 1.0].
    A color with values [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] corresponds to black, and [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
    corresponds to white.
