"""
The 'ID' operator: Begin the image data for an inline image object.

This operator marks the beginning of the image data stream for an inline image object
within a PDF content stream. It is used to specify the raw image data that will be
embedded directly within the content stream.

The inline image data follows this operator and should be in a format that can be
processed by the inline image operator 'EI', which ends the image data sequence.

Refer to the PDF specification for more details on inline images.
