"""
The 'S' operator: Stroke the path.

This operator is used in a PDF content stream to stroke the current path. The path
is outlined using the current graphics state parameters, such as the current line width,
line color, and dash pattern, and the path is drawn along the defined path coordinates.

The operator does not fill the path; it only paints the path outline.

Note:
    The behavior of this operator depends on several graphics state parameters,
    including the current color, line width, line join, and dash pattern.
    See the section on "Path-Painting Operators" for more details on how the path
    is stroked.
