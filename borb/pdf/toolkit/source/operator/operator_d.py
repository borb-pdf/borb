"""
The 'd' operator: Set the line dash pattern in the graphics state.

The 'd' operator is used to define the dash pattern for lines in a PDF content stream. This operator sets the
line dash pattern in the graphics state, specifying how the strokes of paths will be drawn. The pattern is
defined by a sequence of numbers, where the even-indexed numbers represent the lengths of the dashes and
the odd-indexed numbers represent the lengths of the gaps between dashes.

This operator is typically followed by operands specifying the dash pattern and the phase value, which determines
where the pattern starts along the path.

Note:
    For more details on line dash patterns, refer to PDF specification section 8.4.3.6, "Line Dash Pattern."
