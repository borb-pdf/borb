"""
The 'DP' operator: Designate a marked-content point with an associated property list.

The 'DP' operator is used in a PDF content stream to designate a marked-content point, which is a point in the content stream where a marked-content sequence begins. This operator is used to associate a property list with the marked-content point.

The operand `tag` is a name object that indicates the role or significance of the marked-content point. The `properties` operand shall be either:

- An inline dictionary containing the property list.
- A name object that is associated with a property list in the `Properties` subdictionary of the current resource dictionary (for details, see section 14.6.2, "Property Lists").

The `DP` operator is commonly used to label specific points in a PDF document with associated properties, making it possible to reference these points later in the content stream for various purposes, such as styling, annotation, or metadata.

For more details on property lists and their use in marked-content sequences, refer to section 14.6.2, "Property Lists."
