"""
The 'BT' operator: Begin a text object and initialize the text matrix and text line matrix.

The 'BT' (Begin Text) operator is used to begin a text object in a PDF content stream.
It initializes the text matrix (Tm) and the text line matrix (Tlm) to the identity matrix,
which sets up the coordinate system for positioning and rendering text.

After the 'BT' operator, text-related operators can be used to set the font, size, color,
and other properties related to text rendering. The text object is ended with the 'ET' operator.

Note:
    Text objects cannot be nested. A second 'BT' operator cannot appear before an 'ET' operator
    has been encountered to close the first text object.
