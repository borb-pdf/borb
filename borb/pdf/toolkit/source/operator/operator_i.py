"""
The 'i' operator: Set the flatness tolerance in the graphics state.

This operator specifies the flatness tolerance, which determines the precision with
which curved segments of paths are approximated by straight line segments when
rendering.

Parameters:
    - `flatness` is a number in the range 0 to 100:
      - A value of 0 specifies the output device's default flatness tolerance.
      - Higher values allow for less precise approximations, potentially increasing
        rendering speed but reducing accuracy.

Refer to the PDF specification section 10.6.2, "Flatness Tolerance," for more details.
