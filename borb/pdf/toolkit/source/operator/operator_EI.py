"""
The 'EI' operator: End an inline image object.

The 'EI' operator is used in a PDF content stream to mark the end of an inline image object.
It signifies that the inline image object has been fully defined and is now complete.

This operator follows the 'BI' (Begin Inline Image) operator, which starts an inline image object.
After the 'EI' operator, no more content for the inline image should be processed.
This operator is critical for ensuring the proper structure and integrity of inline images in a PDF document.

Inline image objects are used to embed image data directly into the content stream,
and the 'EI' operator indicates the completion of the image's content definition.
