"""
The 'B*' operator: Fill and then stroke the path using the even-odd rule.

The 'B*' operator is used in a PDF content stream to fill and then stroke a path.
Unlike the 'B' operator, it uses the even-odd rule to determine the region to fill.
This rule considers a point inside a path if it is crossed by an odd number of path
segments, ensuring that specific overlapping regions are filled as intended.

The 'B*' operator produces the same result as the 'B' operator, except that the
path is filled as if with the 'f*' operator (even-odd fill) instead of 'f' (nonzero
winding number fill).

Note:
    The filling and stroking portions of this operation consult different values of
    several graphics state parameters, such as the current color. Refer to PDF
    specification section 11.7.4.4, "Special Path-Painting Considerations," for
    additional details on these interactions.
