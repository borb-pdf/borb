"""
The 'G' operator: Set the stroking gray level.

This operator sets the current stroking color space to DeviceGray (or the DefaultGray
color space, as specified in section 8.6.5.6, "Default Colour Spaces") and assigns
a gray level for stroking operations. The `gray` operand must be a number between
0.0 (black) and 1.0 (white).

This operator is commonly used for monochromatic graphics or when working with
grayscale content.
