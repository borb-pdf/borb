"""
The 'q' operator: Save the current graphics state.

This operator is used to save the current graphics state onto the graphics state stack.
It effectively preserves all parameters of the current graphics state, including the
current transformation matrix, colors, line width, and other drawing attributes.

After executing 'q', any subsequent changes to the graphics state (such as transformations,
color changes, etc.) do not affect the saved state. The state can later be restored with
the 'Q' operator, which pops the most recently saved state from the stack and makes it
the current state.

The 'q' operator is useful for temporarily altering the graphics state during drawing
operations, with the ability to revert back to the saved state when needed, allowing for
more flexible drawing control.
