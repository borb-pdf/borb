"""
The 'RG' operator: Set the stroking color space to DeviceRGB and set the color for stroking operations.

This operator sets the current stroking color space to DeviceRGB (or the DefaultRGB color space),
and defines the color to be used for stroking operations. The operands specify the red, green,
and blue components of the color, each as a number between 0.0 (minimum intensity) and 1.0
(maximum intensity).

The color components (red, green, and blue) are applied to the current graphics state and used
when stroking paths. If the color space is set to DeviceRGB, the operands represent the RGB values
for the stroking color.

This operator is important for controlling the appearance of paths, lines, and other graphic elements
in a PDF document, especially when creating colored outlines or borders.

Note:
    The RG operator affects only the stroking color. To set the color for filling paths, use the
    'rg' operator for nonstroking operations.
