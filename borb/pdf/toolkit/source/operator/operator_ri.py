"""
The 'ri' operator: Set the color rendering intent in the graphics state.

This operator specifies the color rendering intent to be used in the graphics state.
The rendering intent controls how colors are mapped in the output device, and it
helps manage color discrepancies between different color spaces (such as from RGB to
CMYK or vice versa).

The operand for this operator is a name object that identifies the rendering intent.
Common rendering intents include "Perceptual", "RelativeColorimetric", "Saturation",
and "AbsoluteColorimetric", which define different ways of handling color conversions.

Note:
    The rendering intent can affect how color values are processed, especially when
    printing or displaying content across devices with varying color gamuts. This operator
    should be used in conjunction with color management settings for consistent color output.
