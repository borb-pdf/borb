"""
The 'd0' operator: Set width information for the glyph and declare that the glyph description specifies both its shape and its colour.

The 'd0' operator is used in Type 3 fonts within a PDF content stream to specify the width of a glyph and to declare
that the glyph's description defines both its shape and its colour. Specifically, this operator sets the horizontal
displacement (wx) of the glyph in the glyph coordinate system, which should match the corresponding value in the
font's Widths array. The vertical displacement (wy) is always set to 0.

This operator is typically used when the glyph description in the Type 3 font executes operators that explicitly set
the glyph's colour.

Note:
    - The 'd0' operator must only be used in a content stream found in a Type 3 font's CharProcs dictionary.
    - The operator name ends with the digit '0' to indicate this specific behavior.
    - For more details on glyph positioning and metrics, refer to PDF specification section 9.2.4, "Glyph Positioning and Metrics."
