"""
The 'C' operator: Append a cubic Bézier curve to the current path.

The 'C' operator is used to append a cubic Bézier curve to the current path in a PDF content stream.
The curve is defined by three points: the current point (which serves as the starting point),
the two control points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), and the endpoint (x3, y3). The curve is drawn from
the current point to the point (x3, y3), using the control points to shape the curve.

After this operator is executed, the current point is updated to the endpoint (x3, y3).

Note:
    Refer to PDF specification section 8.5.2.2, "Cubic Bézier Curves", for more details on how
    Bézier curves are calculated and rendered.
