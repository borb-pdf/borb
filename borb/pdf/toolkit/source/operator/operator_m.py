"""
The 'm' operator: Begin a new subpath by moving the current point to the specified coordinates.

This operator moves the current point to the coordinates (x, y), thereby starting a new subpath.
No connecting line segment is added between the previous point and the new point.

If the previous path construction operator was also 'm', the new 'm' operation overrides the previous one,
effectively resetting the path without any continuation of the prior subpath.

This operator is used to define the starting point of a new subpath, which is an isolated sequence of path segments.
Any further path construction operators (like `l` for line) will then create the path from this new point.
