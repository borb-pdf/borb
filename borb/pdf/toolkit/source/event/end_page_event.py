Event triggered when a page finishes rendering.

This event encapsulates the details of a page being fully rendered in the PDF content stream.
It marks the end of the rendering process for a specific page, providing information about the
page that was rendered, such as the page number and any other relevant details. This event is
triggered once all content for a page has been processed, allowing other components in the PDF
generation pipeline to handle post-processing or cleanup tasks associated with the page.
