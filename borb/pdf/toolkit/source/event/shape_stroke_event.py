Event triggered when a shape is stroked on a page.

This event represents the action of stroking a geometric shape or path on a page in a
PDF document. It encapsulates details such as the document and page context, the shape
being stroked, the stroke's line width, and its color. This allows the event to be
processed, analyzed, or modified by components in the PDF processing pipeline.
