"""
A sink class that captures image events from the PDF content pipeline.

The `GetImages` class sits at the end of the PDF processing pipeline, serving as a sink to
capture and store any image events that pass through the pipeline. It collects image-related
data, such as image objects, their positions, and dimensions, enabling further processing or
extraction of image content from the PDF document.

This class does not alter the content stream but rather listens for image-related events
and stores them for future use or analysis.
