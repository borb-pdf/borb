"""
A base class representing a terminal node in a PDF processing pipeline.

The `Sink` class is designed to act as the endpoint of a pipeline, where events
that pass through the pipeline are captured or processed. Unlike other pipes
that transform or filter events, a `Sink` collects or aggregates the results for
further use, analysis, or storage.

This class is intended to be extended to provide specific implementations
of data aggregation, such as extracting text, images, bounding boxes, or
other processed content from the pipeline.
