"""
Implements a pipeline design pattern for processing PDF content.

The `Pipeline` class orchestrates a sequence of `Pipe` objects to extract, filter, or
process content from a PDF. Each `Pipe` in the pipeline can perform a specific task,
and the `Pipeline` ensures that content flows through the sequence of `Pipe` objects
in the defined order.

This class supports processing both individual `Page` objects and entire `Document`
objects, making it flexible for a variety of PDF manipulation tasks.

The first `Pipe` in the pipeline may be a `Source` object, which acts as the entry
point for processing content streams. Subsequent pipes can perform filtering,
transformation, or extraction tasks.
