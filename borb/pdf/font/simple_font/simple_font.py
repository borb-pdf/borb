"""
Represents a simple font and its properties in a PDF document.

The `SimpleFont` class encapsulates the basic characteristics of a font used in PDF
documents. It provides common properties and methods for working with fonts, such as
character mappings, font metrics, and rendering capabilities. This class serves as the
foundation for more specialized font classes (e.g., `Type1Font`), offering basic font
functionality while allowing for more specific implementations. Simple fonts are used
in a variety of contexts, from basic text rendering to complex document layouts.

        Retrieve the encoding or base encoding of the Simple Font.

        This method determines the encoding used by the font, prioritizing the following cases:
        1. If `/Encoding` is a dictionary and contains a `/BaseEncoding` key, the value of `/BaseEncoding`
           (a `name` object) is returned.
        2. If `/Encoding` is directly a `name` object, it is returned as the font's encoding.

           common default for simple fonts.

        to a standard default.
