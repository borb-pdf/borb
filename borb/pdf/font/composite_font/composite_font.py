"""
Represents a composite font in a PDF.

The `CompositeFont` class is used to represent composite fonts, also known as Type 0 fonts,
in PDF documents. Composite fonts are multi-byte fonts that allow for a large number of
glyphs, making them suitable for representing complex scripts and character sets such as
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK).

This class builds upon the base `Font` class, providing additional support for handling
CIDFonts and CMaps, which map character codes to glyphs and define character encodings
for composite fonts. Composite fonts are often used in conjunction with encoding schemes
that support wide character sets.
