"""
Represents a CIDFont Type 0 in a PDF.

The `CIDType0Font` class models a CIDFont of Type 0, a descendant font type used in
composite fonts within PDF documents. CIDFonts (Character Identifier Fonts) are designed
to support large glyph sets through the use of CIDs, which are numeric glyph identifiers
that decouple character codes from glyph representations.

CIDType0 fonts are typically used for representing CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) scripts
and other large character sets where the traditional 8-bit font encodings are insufficient.
These fonts are used in conjunction with a CMap that defines the mapping between character
codes and CIDs.

This class extends the `Font` base class with additional mechanisms for handling CID
mappings, font descriptors, and system-specific attributes essential for rendering
multi-byte encoded text.
