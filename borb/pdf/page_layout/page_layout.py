"""
A base class for managing the layout of elements on a PDF page.

The `PageLayout` class defines the fundamental structure and behavior for arranging
content on a PDF page. It serves as a foundation for more specific layout types,
such as single-column or multi-column layouts. This class provides core functionality
for positioning and managing various layout elements (e.g., text, images, tables)
within the document.

Subclasses of `PageLayout` can implement different layout strategies, ensuring
flexibility in how content is arranged on the page. This class supports method chaining
for appending elements and adjusting layouts dynamically.
