A class to generate a Markov model used for text generation.

This class constructs a Markov model from a given input corpus, which can
then be used by another class to generate text. The Markov model is built
by analyzing the sequence of words or characters in the input, allowing
for the prediction of the next item in the sequence based on prior data.
