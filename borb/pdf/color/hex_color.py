"""
Represents a color defined by a hexadecimal triplet.

A hex triplet is a six-digit, three-byte hexadecimal number used in HTML, CSS,
SVG, and other applications to represent colors. The three bytes correspond to
the red, green, and blue components of the color, with each byte ranging from
00 to FF in hexadecimal (or 0 to 255 in decimal), indicating the intensity of
each color component.

This representation follows the 24-bit RGB color scheme, where:
- Byte 1: Red value
- Byte 2: Green value
- Byte 3: Blue value

Hex triplets are commonly used in web design to specify colors.
