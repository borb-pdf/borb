"""
Represents an RGB color space based on the additive RGB color model.

This class defines a color space that employs RGB primaries, characterized by
the chromaticities of red, green, and blue. It can produce any color within the
2D triangle formed by these primary colors (excluding factors like transfer function
and white point).

The primary colors are specified using their CIE 1931 color space chromaticity
coordinates (x, y), linking them to human-visible colors.

RGB stands for red, green, and blue.
