"""
Represents a color in the grayscale color model, where each pixel carries only light intensity information.

In digital photography, computer-generated imagery, and colorimetry, a grayscale image is one in which each pixel
is a single sample representing an amount of light, carrying only intensity information. Grayscale images, also
known as black-and-white or gray monochrome images, are composed exclusively of shades of gray. The contrast
ranges from black (weakest intensity) to white (strongest intensity).
