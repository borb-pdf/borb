"""
Represents an HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color.

HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and HSV are alternative representations of the RGB color model,
developed in the 1970s by computer graphics researchers to better align with human color perception.
In these models, colors of each hue are arranged in a radial slice around a central axis of neutral
colors, ranging from black at the bottom to white at the top.

The HSL representation models how different paints mix in the real world, with the lightness dimension
resembling varying amounts of black or white paint in the mixture. For instance, to create "light red,"
a red pigment can be mixed with white paint, corresponding to a high "lightness" value. Fully saturated
colors are placed around a circle at a lightness value of ½, while lightness values of 0 and 1 correspond
to fully black and white, respectively.

The HSV representation, on the other hand, models how colors appear under light. The main difference
between HSL and HSV is that in HSL, maximum lightness results in pure white, while in HSV, maximum
value (brightness) simulates shining a bright white light on a colored object. For example, shining
bright white light on a red object makes it appear brighter and more intense, whereas shining a dim
light on the same object results in a darker appearance.
